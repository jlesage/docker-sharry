      Sharry allows to share files with others in a simple way. It is a self-hosted web
      application. The basic concept is: upload files and get a url back that can then
      be shared.

      - title: Built-in Administrator Account
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, {{ app.friendly_name }} comes with a built-in administrator account,
          with credentials defined by the following environment variables:

          | Variable                             | Description | Default Value |
          |--------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
          | `SHARRY_BACKEND_AUTH_FIXED_USER`     | Username    | `admin`       |
          | `SHARRY_BACKEND_AUTH_FIXED_PASSWORD` | Password    | `changeme`    |

          This account can be used to login to the web interface of {{ app.friendly_name }}.

          > [!CAUTION]
          > For security reason, it is strongly recommended to set a strong password. Do
          > not use the default one!

          If not needed, this account can be disabled by setting any of these two
          variables to an empty value.
      - title: Customizing {{ app.friendly_name }} Configuration
        level: 2
        content: |-
          {{ app.friendly_name }} configuration can be customized via two methods:
            1. Environment variables.
            2. Configuration file.

          All configuration parameters supported by {{ app.friendly_name }} can be consulted
          at https://eikek.github.io/sharry/doc/configure
      - title: Configuration File
        level: 3
        content: |-
          The configuration file of {{ app.friendly_name }} is located at
          `/config/sharry.conf` inside the container. It can be adjusted directly as
          needed.
      - title: Environment Variables
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Container environment variables can be used to override values from the config
          file. Variable names always start with `SHARRY_` and the remainder can be
          derived from the corresponding config option by replacing period `.` and dash
          `-` characters by an underscore `_`, but excluding the root namespace
          `sharry.restserver`. For example, the config option
          `sharry.restserver.bind.port` would be `SHARRY_BIND_PORT` as environment
          variable. A value given as environment variable has priority.

          > [!TIP]
          > A default `SHARRY_` environment variable (as defined under the
          > [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section) can be ignored by
          > setting its value to `UNSET`. This forces the use of the config option value
          > from the configuration file,
      - title: Exposing {{ app.friendly_name }} to the Internet
        level: 2
        content: |-
          {{ app.friendly_name }} cannot be exposed directly to the Internet. Features
          required to allow this is out of scope for {{ app.friendly_name }}. Instead, it
          should run behind a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy can offer a secure access via
          HTTPs to the web interface, while also providing a valid certificate that can be
          verified by browsers.

          See https://eikek.github.io/sharry/doc/reverseproxy for more details.

        The external URL where {{ app.friendly_name }} can be reached (e.g.
        `https://sharry.example.com`). This is used to create absolute URLs and to
        configure the authentication cookie. These URLs are sent to the client, so they
        must resolve back to the {{ app.friendly_name }} server. If "network error" error
        messages are seen in the browser, then this setting is probably not correct. If
        the default value is used, the external URL is obtained dynamically by inspecting
        HTTP headers of the request.
